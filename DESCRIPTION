Description: This package implements a proper statistical setting for
    defining the sampling design for a small area estimation problem.  The
    general random sampling framework is based on sampling without
    replacement and with varying inclusion probabilities.  The sample is
    selected with the cube method based on balancing sampling equations
    useful in the small area situation.  This method allows to obtain the
    minimum-cost sampling solution.
